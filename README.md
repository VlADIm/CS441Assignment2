Hex version of 2048

**Start Date: 1/31/2019**
**Due Date: 2/13/2019**

Create a hexagonal version of the popular app game 2048 in Android Studio.

The back end of the game will be accomplished through use of a map, and a 2-D with side of size five. The map will save the base state of the array and the 2-D array with side of size 5 will be used to collapse the values in the board on swipe.
